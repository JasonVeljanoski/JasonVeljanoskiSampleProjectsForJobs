Our competitors across the water have just commissioned  there first automated shiploader, however this still requires personal to be in the in the cabin. It will be interesting to review 12months of there automation to see if there has been increase in incidents at the terminal or issues with cargo that is seabourne due to incorrect distribution of material into cargo holds. Anti-collision automation would be best for our PCS team to update. ",

        "comment": "These two projects are completely separate, and are not a double up.\r\nThe Project started in FY22 and is being run by the projects team, is to upgrade/replace the original UT station in the Ore Car Wheelshop on the exit side of the Portal Lathe, just prior to the Bearing Press. This piece of equipment, has not functioned correctly from the day of installation, several attempts have been made to rectify, but it is not fit for purpose. This UT station is to detect SUB-SURFACE IMPERFECTIONS within the construction of the wheel, and does not detect surface cracks, it is an ARR requirement to inspect for sub-surface imperfections.\r\nThe second project in FY24, is to develop the required technology (robot x 2) to utilise eddy current heads at the Portal Lathe, to check the wheel discs after machining for SURFACE cracks, if cracks are detected at the Portal Lathe, the intent is to remachine the wheel discs (to the predetermined depth to remove any surface cracks, mitigating the potential for catastrophic wheel failure due to crack propagation) before the wheel leaves the lathe. This will negate the requirement for 3rd party NDT Technicians to be manually testing each and every wheel, and increase workshop efficiency by removing the requirement to reprocess wheels through the Lathe.\r\n This project could be pushed out to 2025, due to commercial breakdowns with Olympus.\r\n",
