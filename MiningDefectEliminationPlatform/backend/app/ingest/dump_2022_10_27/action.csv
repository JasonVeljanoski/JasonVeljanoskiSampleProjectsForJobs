Align brake cooling oil replacement interval at CB with SM and CC. At CB, brake cooling (36L capacity) is being replaced at 2,000 hr service interval. At CC and SM, same oil is being replaced at 700 hrs interval.  2. Field testing/troubleshooting using an external source to pressurise individual brake packs, can potentially create problems with pressure spikes and over pressurising. WesTrac Tech recommendation is don?t pressurise past 1350-1400 psi when checking ability for brake pack to hold pressure.  3. Change the pressure setting in Cat 994H Service Brake Bypass test SWI (CB-01035-WI-MN-0143) from 1500 psi to 1400 psi when using external source such as Enerpac. Please refer to section 7.8 in the document for the pressure limits. Centralize this document for other sites to use the same SWI.  4. Utilise Westrac's return to work document after each final drive fitment. Please see attached '""994H Brake Bypass Failure Investigation"" document for reference. It would be advantageous to make this document as a FMG controlled document and attached to PRT list for SAP final dive c/o work orders.  5. Add an operation item in the final drive c/o work order to clean the brake cooling tank prior to fit the new final drive. This would resolve the contaminant issues arising from brake cooling tank. Cleaning brake cooling tank would take 3 hrs by 1 fitter.  6. Review the repair guidelines around the brake piston seal seating area for quality assurance. Incorrect machining of the seal seating area can cause piston seals to dislodge with time.   7. Investigate the co relation between the heat separation tyre failures on front position and respective final drive failure. It is suspected that tyre heat separation failures may cause excessive stress on the final drive brake pack assy.   ",High,2022-07-30 16:00:00+00,13121,3,2022-07-30 16:00:00+00,1,f,\N,\N

Looking at the engine oil analysis samples for July  prior to the failure they came back with an action comment - The sodium, molybdenum and potassium may indicate a coolant leak. Monitor the amount of coolant use closely. The coolant entry may have been a contributing factor in the build-up of carbon build-up on the intake valve stems and intake and exhaust valve sealing areas as this build up can result from incomplete combustion.

The original intention was to replace both ends but due to the urgency to deliver they decided to replace one end only (to reduce time frame). When re-using the OEM ends, the supplier modifies them by machining internally and a custom insert is fitted (As a result, from the shell ID, the ligament distance to main water flange bolt holes PCD is slightly reduced). Technically this is slightly weaker than OEM, however according to the supplier if the bolts are torqued correctly they are generally no problem.  Another supplier mitigation is to fit special labels to the shell and on the wrapping, that clearly warn of safe handling and bolt tightening procedures. The supplier noted the OEM shell end which has the correct metric threads also suffered multiple cracked bolt holes, pointing to an anomaly that is not a result of the rebuild (there are at least 10 x cracked bolt holes in different locations).  The supplier‚Äôs initial thoughts on the cause were either the Heli-coils did not provide enough thread engagement and/or cast-iron material maybe to be too soft, however both shell ends were affected. There were no Heli-coils in the OEM shell end. Is it recommended the technician installing the coolers use a torque wrench to tighten the bolts as recommended on the labels.  The supplier has used this design for over 15 years and are aware the small M10 bolts on the PCD having a propensity to be over-tightened, the use of our warning labels on safe handling and correct bolt tightening has all but eliminated any issues.",Medium,2019-01-23 16:00:00+00,14080,3,2019-01-23 16:00:00+00,1,f,\N,\N

On top of this I would advise you to clean all external oil lines and inspect where the oil enters the block to see if there is any trace of metal there.  Once the inspection is carried out it would be best to get the machine back to the workshop and drain the engine oil, inspect and change the filters and inspect the sump after 10hrs of operation, if that is all clear then do the same again after 50hrs, if that is all clear then depending on how far away the next planned service is depends on whether you would need to do the same again.""
