The pulley was installed on 21/2/2014 and was in service for 4.25 years prior to this failure. It took 66hrs to rectify the consequential damage and install the spare pulley. During this period trains were loaded direct from the plant, incurring moderate rate loss. During strip down, all the RHS locking element bolts were found to have failed by fatigue cracking (through the threaded section at thrust ring interface), see Fig 2; and the interface between the tapers was corroded, see Fig 3.

This was only discovered after enquiring with the cataloguing team From review other VSD BOMs it was found that capacitors were generally not listed, and fans were only listed for some equipment There is no individual replacement strategy in place for the VSD fan, only the VSD module as whole which is on a 7Y PM02 C/O. This was called in 2018 but W/O was cancelled with no comments as to why.

•	Repair pushed out of the PM22OL21 shutdown

Secondary Cause: 
•	CV948/CV922 blocked chute 
•	Delay significantly extended due to bad weather conditions 

What We Found:
•	Notification raised in SAP for CV948 Splice 1 Skive Lifting Hot Repair on 27/03/22
o	Was scheduled into the PM22OL21 shutdown due to estimated job duration being 12 hours
o	SL701 and RC702 were forced into the shutdown. CV948 was visually inspected, and decision made that it was ok to be pushed out of the shut
•	Conducted several visual inspections by various people
o	On 23/5/2022 head chute inspected and noticed spillage outside the chute and on the rails, possibly indicating an overflow from a blocked chute
o	In general, it was all in good condition and the cleaners looked fine. A chipped tooth was noticed.  
•	Blocked chute event was on 29/05/2022 04:38 and 08:54. The belt damage on 29/05/2022 20:12
o	No feedback if Ops got a chance to inspect the belt
o	The splice failure was picked up by a rip switch. Indicating that it progressively worsened after the blocked chute event 
o	Was running FB product over CV948 and the tonnage rate only decreased during the delay time
•	Extended downtime due to bad weather conditions 

Recommendations:
•	Engineering solution to allow belt repair to be conducted more easily 
o	Reduce downtime during bad weather conditions 
o	Portable and easy to manoeuvre

•	One of the relays installed was the wrong type  

What We Found:
•	One of the relays was the wrong type 
o	Prevented bypass button 
o	Pilz relay could not reset 
o	It is run to end of life and was previous changed out after a breakdown 
o	This led to the extended delay before it was recognised that the wrong relay was installed 
•	The overtravel fault alarm is on the main SCADA screen 
•	Overtravel limit circuit design is an electrical design from OEM 

Recommendations: 
•	Continue investigating if it is a genuine overtravel by involving Metsos and supervisors. This is tracked on 8:10 board
•	Verify that the protective device audit (PDA) checks overtravel recovery
o	Highlight the importance with relevant teams 
•	Continue updating drawings to ensure latest revision
•	Investigate the pressure in the grippers because they should not be decreasing

Additionally, various SOS alerts from Westrac lab were raised in conjunction with the CMA Team review. Engine oil samples were showing a normal and steady wear and contaminants trend until September 7th 2021. During the service carried out on September 7th, POS1 turbo housing was found cracked (refer to WO 101586444). This was replaced at the time as proactive action. On September 25th, an engine oil sample came back rated as ""action required"" for the first time. Westrac lab recommendation was, ""The aluminium and silicon indicate possible dirt entry. Check the seals, breathers, induction system and fill point for dirt entry points. Iron is high. Check for wear debris and resample after any adjustments or repairs"". The CMA Team also reviewed this sample and raised notification 101752864 on October 5th. The notification was not actioned until November 17th, where filters were replaced and engine oil drained. A second ""actioned required"" was flagged by Westrac lab as well as the CMA Team with a new notification (101758847). This appeared to be overlooked as no confirmation time was found nor comments of the job performed. A third ""actioned required"" was sent out by Westrac lab on October 26th. Finally, the lab advised an ""URGENT ACTION REQUIRED"", and the CMA Team raised a breakdown WO (101633370) as an urgent matter ten days before the failure. Westrac lab comments ""Based on 644 hours.The aluminium and silicon indicate possible dirt entry. Check the seals, breathers, induction system and fill point for dirt entry points. The PQ index and iron are high. Chrome is slightly high. Cut the filter open and inspect the media for wear debris and resample after any adjustments or repairs"" Comments from the inspections were, ""changed out engine oil and filters changed out air filters took engine oil sample inspected for dirt entry found multiple engine oil leaks including from heads and filter housing with the largest leak coming from auxillery drive shaft which appears to be the location of dirt entry into engine raised notification to rectify"" WC014 presented engine oil consumption of around 50L on the 25th Nov 2021. Engine oil was topped up again on the 26th with extra 50L due to low engine oil level alarm. WC014 went down on the 27.11.2021 due to low engine oil level alarm and high levels of blow-by . During diagnosis it was found excessive engine exhaust smoke through the rev range and whilst under stall (unburnt fuel and oil). The issue was isolated to the LH bank of the engine, having lower exhaust temps on #2,4,6 Cylinders. It was found POS 3 turbo inlet clamps to be loose and multiple engine oil leaks, including cylinder heads and filter housing, with the largest leak coming from the auxiliary driveshaft.

On inspection from Liebherr, it appeared the bottom bearing has failed. Before we cleaned it up it looked like the whole bottom of the drive was loose, however, upon closer inspection it was the bearing carrier that failed. After the swing drive was removed, two metal fragments were obtained from the drain hole. The smaller piece (10mm x15mm) appears to be part of the bearing cage or running surface, and the larger piece (35mm x 28mm) is from a blown roller bearing. Visual metal and brass particles are visible in the oil running out of the drain port. The surface of both the swing drive and the chassis had visible markings from where the dowel had impacted and metal fragments had been wedged between the chassis and gearbox. Some metal fragments were still lodged in the mating surface of the gearbox.

Secondary Cause: OEM air compressor failed and was replaced with another type of compressor which had no mechanism for extracting moisture. What We Found: The previous compressor had an inbuilt air dryer, so moisture levels were lower. It was found that an air dryer plays a critical role in extracting moisture from the compressor.  This was not considered when the switch to a temporary diesel compressor with no air dryer was made. No functional design specification for the SPF was found during the investigation. So, the importance of an air dryer was not emphasised. There are weekly maintenance checks carried out on the Chainbelt however it was found that there is no official SWI for this process.  Inspection items on Chainbelt lack detail and are open to the interpretation of the person doing the inspection.  No formal process for rectifying faults found during inspections or recording details of completed maintenance. Recommendations: Creating/Updating a functional design specification for continuity of information about how to operate the SPF and what parts are critical, so that the same oversight doesn’t occur in the future. Improve clarity of instructions for how to complete inspections and regular maintenance tasks so that they are completed consistently by all maintainers. Improve reporting following completed maintenance tasks so a record is kept of what has been done.

The door seals looked good, cards and clips were seated correctly, backplane had no noticeable damage and cables were all protected.   There was an ingress in panel by a 40mm diameter hole in the bottom gland plate of the panel. Making the inside of the marshalling panel be subject to moisture, humidity, dirt, dust, and debris.  There is a 104W maintenance strategy in place for the marshalling panels however it doesn’t include backplane or end terminals inspection The last 104W maintenance review had “N/A” written for several inspection points that may have identified the missing end terminals or the hole in the bottom of the marshalling panel Recommendations: Audit all marshalling panels on site in the next few shutdowns. This is to ensure they are up to standard.  Check for installation of din rail screw in end terminals, door seals, glands seal, and overall general conditions inside.

- Inspection on vibe feeder at approx 0425am found magnetic coil damaged.
- Supply isolated while replacement coil was sourced from stores.
- Manual samples were collected to allow train to finish loading.
- New coil installed and stroke, trip and sensitivity calibrated. 
- Feed rate of vibe feeder was determined to be too slow so mechanical assisted in setting the air gap to the specifications for this feeder.
- Tested in manual and auto and verified trip setting operated, and feed rate was acceptable.
- Handed back to OC at approx 11:15am.
